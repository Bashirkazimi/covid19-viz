# covid19-viz
This project aims to visualize reports for countries with the highest number of COVID19 cases around the globe. Additionally, it reports cases for Afghanistan (my home country), and Bangladesh (my wife's home country). The data is loaded in real time from the daily updated report by Johns Hopkins University on [this](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Github repository.
